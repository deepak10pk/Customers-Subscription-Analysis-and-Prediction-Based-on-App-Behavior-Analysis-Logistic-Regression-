# Customers-Subscription Analysis and Prediction Based-on App Behavior Analysis Logistic-Regression

* We will do the customers churn analysis based on the customers behavior on the website or app. We will classify what kind of customers are likely to sign up for the paid subscription of a website. After analyzing
and classifying the dataset, we will be able to do the targeting based
marketing or recommendation to the customers who are likely to sign up
for the paid subscription plan.

* For this problem we will use Logistic Regression algorithm from scikit-learn library.
